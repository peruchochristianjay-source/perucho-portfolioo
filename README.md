# Reflection
    Creating my portfolio on GitHub was a valuable learning experience, but it came with several challenges. One of the first difficulties I faced was getting comfortable with using Git and GitHub together. At first, I found it confusing to manage the repository and push my changes from my local computer to GitHub. To solve this, I watched tutorials, read documentation, and practiced using basic commands like git add, commit, and push. Over time, I started to understand how version control works and became more confident in using it. Another challenge was building the actual portfolio website with HTML and CSS. Since I’m still learning web development, it was hard to get everything looking the way I wanted. I ended up using a simple template from GitHub Pages and customized it to better represent my work. This saved me time and helped me focus on organizing my content clearly.
Publishing the site using GitHub Pages was also a bit tricky at first. I wasn’t sure how to set up the branch or where to place my files. After doing some research and trial and error, I got it working.
Next, I’d like to improve the portfolio by adding more design features and maybe using a CSS framework like Bootstrap. I’d also like to include more detailed information about my projects and make the site more user-friendly. All in all, the process helped me improve both my technical and problem-solving skills.
